Developed for a signin page and list the phone numbers in decending order with an option to edit and delete.

To run:
1. git clone the repo
2. run the command "npm i" on both frontend and backend terminals to install the dependencies.
3. in mongodb compas, create a database with name "Phone_app"
4. use "npm start" in both the terminals to run the code


I believe the changes required to scaled this code for millions of users would be, 
1. to add a stricter form validation
2. Code should be minimized, this involves minimizing the use of resources, such as memory and processing power. The code should also be designed to handle large amounts of data and queries in a fast and efficient manner.
3. The application should be designed to use a distributed architecture that can handle a large number of users.
4. Caching is an important technique that can be used to improve the performance of an application. By caching frequently accessed data, the application can reduce the number of queries it needs to make to the database.

I believe heading in this direction will help us achive a viable product which will cater millions of users.
